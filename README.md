# vim-color-wombat

This is a customized Wombat colour scheme originally based on http://dengmao.wordpress.com/2007/01/22/vim-color-scheme-wombat/ and packaged as a Pathogen bundle.

It's a 256 colour scheme to you'll need to use either the GUI or a term that supports 256 colours like Gnome-terminal or URXVT with the 256 colour patch applied ( as per http://scie.nti.st/2008/10/13/get-rxvt-unicode-with-256-color-support-on-ubunut )

The theme itself contains the settings necessary to enable 256 colours in VIM but using this colour scheme on a non-256 colour term is likely to render you blind... just something to bear in mind.
